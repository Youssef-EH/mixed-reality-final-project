BRANCH PREFAB SETUP GUIDE
===================================

This folder should contain your branch prefabs for the tree pulling system.

CREATING A BASIC BRANCH PREFAB:
--------------------------------

1. CREATE THE BRANCH OBJECT
   - Create Empty GameObject in scene
   - Name it "BranchPrefab_01"

2. ADD VISUAL MESH
   Option A - Simple Visual:
   - Add child: Create → 3D Object → Cylinder
   - Scale: (0.05, 0.3, 0.05) for a thin branch
   - Rotate to align properly
   
   Option B - Custom Model:
   - Drag your branch 3D model as child
   - Adjust scale and rotation

3. ADD MATERIALS
   - Assign a material to the mesh renderer
   - Use existing tree materials from /Assets/Holotna/Mountain/Materials/
   - Or create a custom branch material

4. ADD REQUIRED COMPONENTS
   On the parent BranchPrefab_01 GameObject:
   
   a) XR Grab Interactable
      - Movement Type: Kinematic
      - Attach Transform: (leave default or create attach point)
      - Track Position: Enabled
      - Track Rotation: Enabled
      - Throw On Detach: Enabled
      - Throw Smoothing Duration: 0.1
   
   b) Rigidbody
      - Mass: 0.3
      - Drag: 0.5
      - Angular Drag: 0.5
      - Use Gravity: Enabled
      - Is Kinematic: Enabled (checked)
   
   c) Capsule Collider
      - Radius: 0.05
      - Height: 0.3
      - Direction: Y-Axis
      - Center: (0, 0, 0)
   
   d) Simple Branch (Script)
      - Pull Strength Required: 30
      - Detach Delay: 0.3
      - Mass: 0.3
      - Drag After Detach: 0.5
   
   e) Branch Pull Visualizer (Optional - for debugging)
      - Branch Renderer: Assign the mesh renderer
      - Normal Color: White
      - Grabbed Color: Yellow
      - Pulling Color: Red
      - Show Pull Direction: Enabled

5. CREATE THE PREFAB
   - Drag BranchPrefab_01 from Hierarchy to /Assets/Prefabs/ folder
   - Delete from scene (or keep for testing)

6. CREATE VARIANTS (Optional)
   - Right-click BranchPrefab_01 → Create → Prefab Variant
   - Name variants: BranchPrefab_Small, BranchPrefab_Large, etc.
   - Adjust scale, pull strength, and appearance for variety


USING THE PREFAB:
-----------------

METHOD 1 - Manual Placement:
1. Drag prefab into scene
2. Position on tree
3. Make it a child of Tree01B
4. The SimpleBranch script will handle the rest

METHOD 2 - With TreeBranchManager:
1. Add TreeBranchManager to Tree01B
2. Assign your prefab to "Branch Prefab" field
3. Create empty GameObjects as spawn points
4. Add spawn points to the manager's list
5. Branches spawn automatically on Play


RECOMMENDED BRANCH VARIATIONS:
------------------------------

Small Branch:
- Scale: (0.7, 0.7, 0.7)
- Pull Strength: 20
- Mass: 0.2

Medium Branch (Default):
- Scale: (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- Pull Strength: 30
- Mass: 0.3

Large Branch:
- Scale: (1.5, 1.5, 1.5)
- Pull Strength: 50
- Mass: 0.5


TESTING CHECKLIST:
------------------
□ Can grab branch with XR controller
□ Visual feedback shows when grabbed
□ Pull detection works (branch detaches)
□ Branch has physics after detaching
□ Can throw detached branch
□ Collisions work properly
□ Performance is acceptable with multiple branches


COMMON ISSUES:
--------------

Issue: Can't grab branch
Fix: Check XR Interaction Layer Mask on both interactor and interactable

Issue: Branch disappears when detached
Fix: Ensure branch isn't being destroyed or moved off-screen

Issue: Branch is too easy/hard to pull
Fix: Adjust "Pull Strength Required" value

Issue: Branch floats
Fix: Check Rigidbody "Use Gravity" is enabled after detach
