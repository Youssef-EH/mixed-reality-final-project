FIX: CANNOT GRAB BRANCH
========================================

PROBLEM:
You can't grab the branch - no feedback when controllers touch it.

ROOT CAUSE:
Missing XR Interaction Manager in the scene!

SOLUTION - CHOOSE ONE:
==================

OPTION 1: AUTO-FIX (RECOMMENDED)
---------------------------------
1. Select the /Input GameObject in your scene
2. Click "Add Component"
3. Search for "XRInteractionManagerAutoSetup"
4. Add it
5. Enter Play Mode - it will create the manager automatically!

OPTION 2: MANUAL FIX
--------------------
1. In Hierarchy, right-click empty space
2. Create Empty GameObject
3. Name it "XR Interaction Manager"
4. With it selected, click "Add Component"
5. Search for "XRInteractionManager"
6. Add it
7. Enter Play Mode and test!

VERIFY THE FIX:
===============
After adding the XR Interaction Manager:

1. Enter Play Mode
2. Check Console for these messages:
   ✓ "[VRBranchPull] XR Interaction Manager assigned: ..."
   ✓ "[VRBranchPull] Collider registered: CapsuleCollider, IsTrigger: False"
   ✓ "[VRBranchPull] Branch setup complete..."

3. Move VR controller near branch
4. You should see:
   ✓ "[VRBranchPull] HOVER ENTERED by Near-Far Interactor!" (cyan color)

5. Press grip button to grab
6. You should see:
   ✓ "[VRBranchPull] Branch grabbed by Near-Far Interactor"

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
====================

Check these things:

1. COLLIDER TOO BIG?
   Your capsule collider has:
   - Center: (0.27, 4.12, 0.96) - very offset!
   - Radius: 1.08 - very large!
   
   Try adjusting to match the actual branch size:
   - Center: (0, 0, 0)
   - Radius: 0.1 to 0.2
   - Height: match your branch length

2. LAYER MISMATCH?
   - Branch GameObject layer: Default
   - XRGrabInteractable Interaction Layers: Default (1)
   - Controller Interaction Layers: Default (1)
   All should match!

3. CONTROLLERS NOT SETUP?
   - Make sure Left/Right Controller have Near-Far Interactor
   - Check they're enabled and active

4. RIGIDBODY ISSUE?
   - Is Kinematic: FALSE ✓
   - Use Gravity: FALSE ✓
   - Make sure it's not frozen/constrained

DEBUGGING STEPS:
===============

1. Check Console during Play Mode
   Look for error messages in red

2. Watch Scene View Gizmos
   - Yellow sphere = min pull distance
   - Should see connection to tree

3. Test with simple grab
   Create a cube with:
   - Rigidbody
   - Box Collider
   - XRGrabInteractable
   
   If cube works but branch doesn't:
   → Problem is branch-specific (likely collider)

4. Check XR Device Simulator
   Make sure it's enabled and working
   - WASD to move camera
   - Right mouse to look
   - Left Ctrl/Shift for hands

FINAL CHECKLIST:
===============
□ XR Interaction Manager exists in scene
□ Branch has VRBranchPull component
□ Branch has CapsuleCollider (not trigger)
□ Branch has Rigidbody (not kinematic)
□ Branch has XRGrabInteractable
□ Branch is child of Tree02
□ Console shows setup messages
□ No red errors in console

Once you see "HOVER ENTERED" in console,
grabbing should work!
