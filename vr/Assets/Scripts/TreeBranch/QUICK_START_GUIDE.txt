VR BRANCH PULL - QUICK START GUIDE
========================================

NEW CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION CREATED!
Location: /Assets/Scripts/TreeBranch/

STEP-BY-STEP SETUP:
==================

1. SELECT THE BRANCH GAMEOBJECT
   - In Hierarchy, navigate to: Tree01B > Branch01
   - Click on Branch01 to select it

2. REMOVE OLD SCRIPTS
   - In the Inspector, find these components:
     ✗ BranchDebugger
     ✗ BranchPullInteraction  
     ✗ BranchJointSetup
   
   - Click the three dots (⋮) on each component
   - Select "Remove Component"
   - Repeat for all three old scripts

3. UPDATE RIGIDBODY SETTINGS
   Current settings on Branch01:
   - Mass: 0.3
   - Is Kinematic: TRUE ← Change this to FALSE
   - Use Gravity: TRUE ← Change this to FALSE
   - Collision Detection: Discrete ← Change to Continuous
   
   The script will manage gravity and physics after detaching.

4. UPDATE XRGRABINTERACTABLE SETTINGS
   Current settings on Branch01:
   - Movement Type: Kinematic ← The script will change this, keep as is
   - Track Position: TRUE ✓
   - Track Rotation: TRUE ✓
   - Retain Transform Parent: TRUE ← Change to FALSE
   
   This ensures the branch can be pulled away from the tree.

5. ADD THE NEW SCRIPT
   - With Branch01 selected
   - Click "Add Component" button
   - Type "VRBranchPull"
   - Click on it to add

6. CONFIGURE VR BRANCH PULL
   Recommended starting values:
   
   PULL SETTINGS:
   - Pull Distance Threshold: 0.15
   - Pull Time Required: 1.5
   - Max Stretch Distance: 0.3
   
   PHYSICS:
   - Joint Spring Strength: 500
   - Joint Damping: 50
   - Detach Force: 5
   
   AUDIO:
   - Snap Sound: (Optional - drag audio clip)
   - Detach Sound: (Optional - drag audio clip)
   
   DEBUG:
   - Enable Debug Logs: ✓ (ON for testing)
   - Show Gizmos: ✓ (ON to see visual aids)

7. OPTIONAL: ADD VISUAL FEEDBACK
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Type "BranchVisualFeedback"
   - Configure colors and effects as desired

8. TEST IT!
   - Enter Play Mode (or deploy to VR headset)
   - Grab the branch with your controller
   - Pull it away from the tree
   - Hold stretched for 1.5 seconds
   - Watch it break free!

WHAT HAPPENS:
=============
1. When you grab the branch, it starts tracking your hand
2. The joint keeps it connected to the tree but allows pulling
3. Pull it far enough (0.15m) and hold for 1.5 seconds
4. The branch breaks free with realistic physics
5. Gravity kicks in and you can throw it around

TESTING TIPS:
============
- Watch the Scene view with "Show Gizmos" ON
  • Yellow sphere = minimum pull distance
  • Red sphere = maximum stretch distance
  • Green/Red line = current pull state

- Check the Console for debug messages
  • Shows when pulling starts
  • Shows pull progress
  • Shows when branch detaches

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
❌ Branch won't grab?
   → Make sure XRGrabInteractable is enabled
   → Check collider is not set to "Is Trigger"

❌ Branch detaches immediately?
   → Increase Pull Distance Threshold
   → Increase Pull Time Required

❌ Branch won't detach?
   → Decrease Pull Distance Threshold
   → Decrease Pull Time Required
   → Check Console logs for pull progress

❌ Branch feels too stretchy/stiff?
   → Adjust Joint Spring Strength
   → Higher = stiffer, Lower = stretchier

❌ Error about parent?
   → Make sure Branch01 is a child of Tree01B in hierarchy

TUNING FOR YOUR NEEDS:
=====================
Easy Mode (casual gameplay):
- Pull Distance Threshold: 0.1
- Pull Time Required: 1.0

Normal Mode (balanced):
- Pull Distance Threshold: 0.15
- Pull Time Required: 1.5

Hard Mode (realistic):
- Pull Distance Threshold: 0.2
- Pull Time Required: 2.5

FILES CREATED:
=============
✓ VRBranchPull.cs - Main pulling script
✓ BranchVisualFeedback.cs - Optional visual effects
✓ README.txt - Detailed documentation
✓ QUICK_START_GUIDE.txt - This file

NEXT STEPS:
==========
- Test and tune the pull settings
- Add audio clips for realistic sounds
- Add particle effects when branch breaks
- Create more branches with same setup
- Adjust physics values to your liking
